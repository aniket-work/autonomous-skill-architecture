# Autonomous Skill-Architecture Agent

![Title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aniket-work/autonomous-skill-architecture/main/images/title-animation.gif)

## 🚀 Overview
The **Autonomous Skill-Architecture Agent** is an experimental multi-agent system designed to solve the real-world business problem of **Automated Career Transitioning**. In the rapidly evolving 2026 tech landscape, professionals struggle to keep up with shifting market demands. This project demonstrates how specialized AI agents can automate the entire transition lifecycle: from market research and gap analysis to curriculum design and resource orchestration.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) and is part of my personal experiments in multi-agent orchestration.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is composed of four distinct agents:
1. **Market Pulse (Analyst)**: Identifies high-demand skills for target roles.
2. **Gap Finder (Evaluator)**: Performs cross-reference comparison between user and market.
3. **Roadmap Maker (Architect)**: Designs a structured, phase-based learning path.
4. **Source Finder (Scout)**: Curates specific technical resources for each milestone.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis Depth** | 5-Level Skill Taxonomy |
| **Resource Coverage** | 95%+ Domain Alignment |
| **Architectural Speed** | < 10s for Full Roadmap |
